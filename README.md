### Starting game

If the game won't launch with this procedure, new build is needed.

1) In order to launch the **server** you have to go with terminal in its jar folder and
   write: `java -jar nameJar.jar --port port`
    - `--port` is an optional field.

2) In order to launch the **client** you have two options:
    - Repeat the same procedure and write `java -jar jarName.jar --graphics gui --address address --port port`
        - `--address` and `--port` are optional fields.
        - You can write `cli` instead of `gui`.
    - Double-click on the file for playing with graphics.
